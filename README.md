**Venture Guts Credo**

• You have to go above and beyond the call of duty to succeed as an entrepreneur. And sometimes it takes others to help us get there.

• It takes serious Guts to overcome entrepreneurial obstacles; this is how nature filters out entrepreneurs from wantrepreneurs.

• Having Guts, isn't just about physical action. It's about being strong enough to break down your own mental barriers, test your ideas, and act on real market data.
